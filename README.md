Bootstap-Sass Windows 7 Theme
===================

Synopsis
--------
This is a website theme built to model the look and feel of Windows 7. It's created using Bootstrap with Sass. By editing the variables and adding extra CSS, this is made possible.

Motivation
----------
This project was for work. It's made to help users feel immediately comfortable with a web application since many have dealt with Windows 7 at some time in the recent past. It's an experimental side project to make progress on during slow work days.
